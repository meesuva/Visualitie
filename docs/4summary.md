# Summary
The relationship between wealth and happiness has long been debated, and this project aimed to explore whether money truly buys happiness. Using global data, two perspectives were investigated: one linking happiness to economic indicators, and the other to broader socioeconomic factors. The economic variables examined were GDP per capita, GNI per capita, and the Gini index, while the socioeconomic variables included education expenditure, life expectancy, and unemployment rate. The analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between happiness and both GDP and GNI per capita, suggesting that national income levels are important predictors of well-being. Life expectancy also showed a strong connection to happiness, highlighting the role of public health. While education spending and income inequality demonstrated weaker relationships, unemployment exhibited a mild negative association with happiness. These findings support the notion that economic prosperity does influence happiness, but also emphasize that broader social conditions play a critical role. In conclusion, to answer our perspectives: happiness *does* come from both economic and socioeconomic prosperity. Nonetheless, further research with more nuanced data would be necessary to fully understand the complex drivers behind national well-being.
