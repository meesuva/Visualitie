# Introduction
For many years, happiness and well-being have been the key focus for societies in our world. The question of how much wealth influences happiness and whether a country's "richness" is related to the well-being of its people is an important metric to understand happiness across the world.
While it's often said that “money can’t buy happiness,” this view is more complex than it first appears.
This data story will explore the relationship between financial factors and happiness across different countries, using data from the World Happiness Report 2019. The report assesses happiness based on several indicators, e.g. GDP per capita, health and freedom. The report allows us to investigate how strongly income correlates with happiness and well-being. 

This data story will mainly visualize and analyze whether higher income levels correlate with greater happiness, however we will also analyze other factors that might relate with happiness in society.

# Perspective 1: Happiness comes from economic prosperity
From this viewpoint, economic wealth is a fundamental driver of happiness. Higher income levels often lead to better access to healthcare, education, housing, and opportunities for personal growth, all of which contribute to overall well-being. Countries with higher GDP per capita often score higher on happiness indexes, suggesting a strong link between financial stability and life satisfaction. A landmark study by Deaton and Kahneman (2010) found that income is positively associated with life evaluation, especially in wealthier countries. Proponents of this view argue that while money may not guarantee happiness, it provides the security and freedom necessary to pursue a fulfilling life. In this sense, financial prosperity is seen not as a direct source of happiness but as a foundation that enables it.

# Perspective 2: Happiness comes from prosperity 
This perspective emphasizes that beyond a certain threshold, more money does little to improve happiness. Studies show that once basic needs are met, the marginal gains in happiness from additional wealth diminish. Social relationships, mental and physical health, purpose, and a sense of belonging often outweigh financial status when it comes to long-term happiness. Research from the World Happiness Report (2017) supports this, showing that countries with similar GDP levels can have vastly different happiness scores due to variations in social support, trust, and freedom. Supporters of this view also point to communities with modest incomes but high well-being, suggesting that non-material factors play a stronger role. From this angle, the pursuit of money alone is unlikely to lead to a truly content society.
